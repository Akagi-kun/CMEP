This is the repository of the CMEP project. A scriptable game engine written in C++, using the Vulkan API for rendering.
This project is currently in early stages of development and although basic demos (as shown in the `./examples/` subdirectory) can be made with it, the API often goes through changes and lacks in functionality.

## Usage

### Install Vulkan SDK
Before you build the engine you first have to install the Vulkan SDK, download it from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/ and install it/unpack it.

Depending on your platform (Linux needs this, untested on MacOS), it might be necessary to set the `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable to a valid Vulkan SDK location so cmake finds all includes. Use either the `setup-env.sh` script (`source path/to/vulkansdk/setup-env.sh`) that comes with the Vulkan SDK or set it manually.

### Clone repository and submodules
First use `git clone "https://github.com/Snezhnaya-chan/CMEP.git"` in a new clean directory to clone repository.

Then `git submodule init` and `git submodule update --recursive` to initialize and clone dependency submodules.

### Project build
To build the project, use the following steps, depending on your selected generator:

<details>
<summary>Single-config (Makefiles, Ninja)</summary>

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<CONFIG> .
cmake --build . --target rungame
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>Multi-config (Visual Studio)</summary>

```sh
cmake .
cmake --build . --target rungame --config <CONFIG>
```

</details>

The `rungame` target will also build all of it's dependencies. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Where `<CONFIG>` should be replaced with a valid configuration value (Either `Debug` or `Release`, case-sensitive)

> [!WARNING]
> By default most generators build the Debug configuration if none is specified, this may not be what you want.

### Build an example

There are CMake targets provided for every example:
```
cmake --build . --target <examplename>
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Where `<examplename>` is a name of a subdirectory under `./examples/` (e.g. `floppybirb`)

### Running
To start the engine use the `rungame` executable. This is located under the `./build/` subdirectory if the build is successful.Â¨
A `./build/game/` directory with valid content is necessary for startup, this can be created by building an example.

### Building documentation
HTML documentation can be generated using doxygen, the `build_docs` cmake target is provided for this purpose, output is by default generated in the `./docs/output` directory.
